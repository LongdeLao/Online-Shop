## API Integration and Data Fetching

### Overview

This application uses the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com) to fetch product data. The API provides data in `ProductResponse` format, which is mapped to the internal `ItemModel`.

### Data Models

- **`ProductResponse`**: Raw data model from the API with fields like `id`, `title`, `price`, `description`, `category`, and `image`.
- **`ItemModel`**: Internal model used within the application, possibly with additional computed properties.

### `fetchProducts` Function

The `fetchProducts` function performs the following:

1. **Fetches Data**: Makes a network request to the Fake Store API.
2. **Decodes Response**: Parses JSON data into `ProductResponse` objects.
3. **Maps to Internal Model**: Transforms `ProductResponse` into `ItemModel`.
4. **Updates State**: Refreshes the applicationâ€™s data state.
